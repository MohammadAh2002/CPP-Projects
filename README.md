# Projects
This repository contains various projects I have worked on.
Each project demonstrates different aspects of  programming, including algorithms, data structures, object-oriented design, and more.

## Projects organization
Each project in this repository is organized into its own directory, ensuring that all related files are kept together.
In every folder, you will find a README file that explains the details of the project, how to view or run it, and any additional information depending on the projectâ€™s needs.
